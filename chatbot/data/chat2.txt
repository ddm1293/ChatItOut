********* STAGE 1: INVITATION *********

Coach: Hi Brianna, how are things going today?

Client: They're okay. I'm having some problems with my roommate because they haven't been paying their rent on time.

Coach: Okay. So tell me what's happening there.

Client: So it's been about a month since their rent. Their share of the rent was due, and I've been waiting, and they keep telling me that they're gonna pay it but it's not happening. I'm just feeling really stressed out.

Coach: Okay. And what have you done so far to try to resolve this, if anything?

Client: I've spoken to them a couple times, just asking if they have any plans to pay it, and they tell me that they were working on getting a loan, but there hasn't been any progress.

Coach: Okay. So you've tried, but you're not getting anything different?

Client: Yeah.

Coach: So how are you feeling about this?

Client: I'm feeling really stressed because, you know, we live in a expensive place, and I don't have the money to cover their share of the rent. Especially since the next rent payment is coming up, and I'm really worried that they're not gonna be able to pay that, so then I'll have to cover for 2 months worth of rent payments.

Coach: Okay, so you're feeling stressed. How else are you feeling?

Client: I'm feeling anxious about having to have a difficult conversation with them.

Coach: How strongly are you feeling these emotions?

Client: Pretty strongly, and it feels like it's just getting worse as time passes.

Coach: Okay, and how do you believe your roommate's feeling about it?

Client: I think they're probably stressed as well, but I hope they're stressed enough to make them want to work on it.

Coach: So if you're both feeling stressed and you're both living together, how is that impacting your relationship?

Client: I think we had a good friendship, but it seems like we're avoiding each other now, and we just kind of go to our separate rooms when we get home.

Coach: Okay, so that sounds like something you'd want to change. Not only the situation with the rent, but also the situation with how you're feeling being in the same space together.

Client: Yeah.

Coach: So, how do you think you could describe the situation to your roommate in a way that they could hear it differently than how you've tried it before?

Client: I think maybe instead of sugarcoating it, I want to get straight to the point and let them know how it's affecting me. So instead of simply just asking them when they're planning on paying the rent, try to explain why it's causing me so much stress.

Coach: So you're able to say that to me. Do you think you'd be able to use the same words with your roommate?

Client: I think that's one of the things I'm worried about. I don't want to ruin our good friendship by upsetting them or making them feel guilty. But I also want something to change.

Coach: And if you were to say that exact same thing to them, how do you think they would hear it?

Client: I think it's hard predict because I haven't known them for that long, so I'm worried. They could be understanding, or they might feel upset and yell at me.

Coach: Okay. So how do you think you could invite them into the conversation in a way that will help create safety for them?

Client: Maybe I could ask them to just chat in the living room, in like a comfy area on the couch after a day at work or school.



********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********

Coach: You use the words "I'm stressed" and "I don't want to upset you", and "I need things to change". If you were to say that to your roommate, how accurate do you think that would be?

Client: I think, very accurate.

Coach: What's the worst thing they could say?

Client: They could start crying and start talking about how stressed they are but not really consider my feelings.

Coach: And how would that be for you if that happened?

Client: I think that would be very upsetting for me as well, because I think in the past I've been quite a pushover, so I'm worried that I'll give in to their tactics.

Coach: What do you think you could do in that situation if that were to occur that would help you stay true to your conversation?

Client: I think, just try my best to remain calm and remind them that I understand where they're coming from, and I understand that they're stressed as well, but just reiterate that I'm also under stress from the situation.

Coach: And if you're both stressed in the situation, that's not a place you wanna stay.

Client: No!

Coach: So you need to talk about it in order to move on.

Client: I suppose so, yes.

Coach: Okay, what else do you think could create safety for you and for the other person in having this conversation?

Client: I think maybe I could just use friendly language.

Coach: Okay, what would be an example of friendly language?

Client: "I hope you're doing well", and... that's all I can really think of at the moment.



********* STAGE 3: EXCHANGE *********

Coach: Okay, good. How do you hope the conversation would unfold between you?

Client: I'd hope it would remain calm and emotions remain level between the both of us. But I also hope things would change, and rent would obviously be paid, or at least a set plan to pay the rent would unfold.

Coach: Okay. So all of that sounds like it's important for you to be able to convey to your roommate.

Client: Yeah.

Coach: Good. So, what's important to you in this situation? What would be important to be achieved in a good outcome?

Client: I think, other than the plan, I really would like to maintain a friendship with my roommate, or at least keep some level of friendliness there and not have any tension, because we do live together.

Coach: Okay. So aside from the plan, you also want a supportive and friendly home atmosphere?

Client: Yeah.

Coach: And what would the plan address?

Client: I think it would address the plan to pay off the recent payments, but also a plan to avoid this situation in the future.

Coach: Okay, and if you were to ask your roommate what would be important to them, what do you think they would say?

Client: I think they would say the same thing, because I'm sure it's stressful for them not being able to pay their share of their rent, and having this loom over them. So yeah, I think they would say something similar.

Coach: What else would you like to know from their point of view?

Client: I think I would like to know exactly what they've been working on this whole time that the rent hasn't been paid, and how it is affecting them. Just so I don't feel like they just don't care.

Coach: Right. So that would be an important question to ask.

Client: Yeah.



********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********

Coach: Okay. So if this conversation goes really well, and you agree on a plan, what do you think some aspects of that plan might entail? What could actually be created in terms of an agreement between you that would be satisfying for you?

Client: I hope for the future that they would find another source for the money, at least temporarily. Whether it be through help of a parent or something like that, just so that they can get it in. And then for the previously due payment, I suppose it would be the same solution.

Coach: So that you have some assurance and some predictability that the bills will be paid on time?

Client: Yeah.

Coach: Okay. And what do you think you might be able to do to contribute to a good outcome?

Client: I think, like, I said, just remaining calm and coming from a place of understanding, but also trying to get my point across and maybe I can offer to help them come up with a plan.

Coach: Okay. So we've talked about how you're feeling about this situation and how you think they are feeling about it. We talked about how you could invite them into the conversation using words and phrases that will create safety and still get your point across. And you've talked about what's important to you and what you believe is important to them about the situation, both in terms of the finances and the rent and your home environment. How prepared do you feel now? Do you feel like you are now ready to start this conversation with them, should the opportunity arise?

Client: I think I'm much better prepared than I was at the beginning for sure.

Coach: Okay. So I'd encourage you to download this conversation or save it. Read through it for the words and questions and phrases that are the most meaningful for you, that create curiosity, that create clarity and empathy, and that help you structure your conversation in a way that you feel will be inviting and safe for everyone. Once you've had the conversation, come back and let's reflect on it.

Client: Okay. Thank you.

Coach: You're welcome. Good luck!



********* PHASE 5: REFLECTION *********

Coach: So, Brianna, you've had your conversation. How did it go?

Client: I think it went well. I feel like I was worried for nothing. She took it really well. I'm still a bit worried because nothing changed right away but, like we discussed, we do have a plan in place.

Coach: Okay, and how do you feel about that plan?

Client: I feel pretty good. It's not 100% bulletproof, but I think it should work.

Coach: How do you think they feel about the plan?

Client: They seem to feel better from what I can tell, less stressed. They actually were worried that I was really mad and was going to yell at them. So I think they also feel relieved.

Coach: That's really good to hear. What did you do well in the conversation? What did you learn that you could do well?

Client: I think remaining calm and coming from that place of understanding really helped me, and not just talking about how I feel, but trying to understand how they feel. I think they felt safer.

Coach: Uh huh. What would you do differently if anything? And why?

Client: I think the only thing I would do differently is, do this a lot sooner, and not put it off for so long.

Coach: And what else have you learned in this situation that you could apply to future conversations with other people in different situations?

Client: I think I now have the confidence in myself to be able to approach conflict in a more healthy way, and not be so worried about things that could go wrong, and taking preventative measures to make sure that things don't go wrong.

Coach: That sounds like a good plan, and I'm always here to help you if you need it.

Client: Okay. Thank you.

Coach: It was my pleasure, Brianna.
