I'm feeling frustrated at work, for sure.\n\nCoach: Okay, so tell me what's happening.\n\nClient: Well, where do I begin? So, I don't like my boss right? And a lot of people in my office don't like him either because he doesn't give a lot of direction and support to us, yet he feels like we have to take workshops to improve our time management skills. I'm just not comfortable with this whole thing and I'm not sure how to tell him that it's probably also you, not just us.\n\nCoach: What have you tried so far to approach this situation?\n\nClient: I haven't, that's the thing. I'm not sure if I should approach him. My boss did ask my feelings towards the workshop, but he didn't realize he could be the problem. I'm struggling here, right? My colleagues have been talking about shit. But I'm just not sure so I haven't done much.\n\nCoach: Okay, so what's kept you from trying to resolve it?\n\nClient: Yeah, that's a really good question. I'm scared, honestly, I mean it's my boss, and you know my future sort of depends on him. If I say something that's out of my lane, I'm not sure if I would still be seen as a good employee or a good person in the workplace. I mean, my colleagues have been talking shit, but I don't know if I want to be the one who brings the bad news to him. I'm not sure if I have the power to say that and I'm scared about the consequences.\n\nCoach: You're feeling like it could be risky to bring it up.\n\nClient: Yeah, for sure.\n\nCoach: How strongly are you feeling about this right now?\n\nClient: I mean I personally don't think it's that bad, but because it's being talked about in the entire office, on one hand I think we should tell him because I think he needs to know that people are feeling this way. But on the other hand I have some personal feelings towards the situation. I occasionally feel like he needs to be more transparent and needs to provide more directions. So I feel like I should talk to him.\n\nCoach: Okay. So it sounds like you're getting yourself ready to have that kind of conversation with him.\n\nClient: Yeah, but it's about how. I mean, I have some good ideas in my mind about what to say, but I just can't bring up the courage to actually tell him.\n\nCoach: Okay, well, let's work on it together. How does that sound?\n\nClient: Okay.\n\nCoach: Okay. So how do you believe your boss is feeling about the situation?\n\nClient: I imagine he could probably sense something, right? If people are talking behind his back. I'm not sure. I think he probably knows something's going on, but not sure, and there's probably not a lot of opportunities to ask. Maybe he also feels awkward about it or scared to find out the truth, I guess.\n\nCoach: Okay, so it sounds like you want to make improvements to the working relationship, not only between you and him but also between him and the rest of the team.\n\nClient: Absolutely. I think it's important for us to have a good working relationship as a team because that's how we improve and how we feel safe. Because otherwise, you feel like people are not trusting him and the work is not getting done properly. Yeah, it's not great.\n\nCoach: Okay. So from what you're telling me so far, it sounds like you have some pretty positive intentions around this conversation and that's a really great place to start. So let's think about how we might actually start this conversation with your boss. So if you were to think about describing the problem to him, how would you describe it?\n\nClient: Hmm! That's a hard one! English is my second language, so I'm not sure if the words I choose are appropriate or not or if I'm being sensitive enough or not. Hopefully I will frame it around trust, I think that would probably be a good place to start.\n\nCoach: So trust is certainly something you want to build into your future", "doc_id": "b6fbf38c-b4b2-4008-8165-9c74909412bd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "005e745d9bd36d67ea6bd354df8a5626dad9318af506ce2823ad146d423795ba", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3899}, "relationships": {"1": "0f7eca4e-c028-473f-83a7-ce8f61920fd4", "3": "60330c06-07e1-4672-ad85-41ea99ae8a7b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "60330c06-07e1-4672-ad85-41ea99ae8a7b": {"__data__": {"text": "we improve and how we feel safe.

Hopefully I will frame it around trust, I think that would probably be a good place to start.\n\nCoach: So trust is certainly something you want to build into your future working relationship. If you were to go to him and say, \"I'd like to talk about trust\", how do you think he would respond to that?\n\nClient: I don't know. I think now that you said it, I think it's all quite strong, so maybe I should change it a little bit and say \"I just want to talk about what's happened lately to some of the projects and my feelings\", maybe that's a good place to start instead of just going to trust right away?\n\nCoach: So you could talk about some recent experience, or about working together?\n\nClient: Yes, I think that's a good place to start.\n\nCoach: Okay, and then how do you think he might respond to that if you were to say that?\n\nClient: I think he'll be very open to it because that's something we talk about all the time anyways. So, I could say \"I want to chat about some of the projects\", and he'd be very open to it.\n\nCoach: Okay, good. So that might be a good opening invitation to connect. \"Hey, I'd like to talk to you about some recent experience working on the projects together\".\n\nClient: Yeah, that'd be a great place to start.\n\nCoach: Good. So when you think about this problem, what role do you think you might have played in actually creating it?\n\nClient: I mean I for sure didn't tell him how everyone feels and also of course I'm probably not telling him how I feel sometimes and he's not necessarily aware of our feelings. I think that's probably the main thing.\n\nCoach: So, if you were to share with him why you haven't brought this up in the past, or what role you might have played in getting to where you are now, how do you think he would respond to that?\n\nClient: If I said that I feel like I didn't tell you how I feel, I think he'd be happy, right? Because if someone is taking the courage to share their feelings, I think he'd appreciate it.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********\n\nCoach: And then what else do you think you might be able to say in that first connecting conversation, right at the beginning, that would help create a sense of safety and comfort for him to join you in that conversation?\n\nClient: I think things like my intention, you know I'm not here to complain but to help us to move forward and really just explain what my intentions are and how I've been struggling with this. I'm not sure if I should tell him because of my concerns. I think my intentions and concerns would be helpful.\n\nCoach: And then he'd likely want to know what the problem is. How do you think you can describe the problem in a way that he can hear it?\n\nClient: That's the hardest part. It's a harsh truth, and I might need to be sensitive about it. I haven't found the right phrasing but if I try, it would probably be something like, \"Hey, I notice that people have some feelings that they have to share with you, and I think it is in the way of a good working relationship\".\n\nCoach: Okay, I like that and I would encourage you to speak from your own perspective rather than saying \"people\", and there's a reason for that. Because you are the one that is going to have the conversation with him, and the danger of saying \"we\" is that he could feel like he is being ganged up on. So if you speak from your own perspective, I think it would be easier for him to have", "doc_id": "60330c06-07e1-4672-ad85-41ea99ae8a7b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2fb319a2cde89018d6b2766be7e0bade8907e111cea12be2ed00455fe052372d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3209, "end": 7273}, "relationships": {"1": "0f7eca4e-c028-473f-83a7-ce8f61920fd4", "2": "b6fbf38c-b4b2-4008-8165-9c74909412bd", "3": "7f5b9c1a-1e9e-494e-a10c-027d37379980"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f5b9c1a-1e9e-494e-a10c-027d37379980": {"__data__": {"text": "think you can describe the problem in a way that he can hear it?\n\nClient: That's the hardest part.

So if you speak from your own perspective, I think it would be easier for him to have this conversation rather than feeling like he's having a conversation with not only you, but also people who are not in the room.\n\nClient: Right, and no one wants to feel like they're being ganged up on.\n\nCoach: What do you think about what I'm saying?\n\nClient: Okay, that makes sense, but at the same time it puts me in the hot seat because he could say \"Oh, I've never heard this from anyone else, so maybe it's just you\".\n\nCoach: So how would you respond if he did say that?\n\nClient: \"Maybe people are too scared\"? I'm not sure.\n\nCoach: What do you think would be the easiest for him to hear?\n\nClient: \"Maybe I'm the first one who had the courage to tell you\"?\n\nCoach: And that sounds like it might be true.\n\nClient: It is true, yeah. Or maybe he's heard this already. Or he has a concern and he feels validated because he knows something is going on.\n\nCoach: So part of the art of having these kinds of conversations is that we don't know what the other person will say, and at the same time it's kind of good to think about what they might say so that we have thought through and considered a respectful response that is true for you.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 3: EXCHANGE *********\n\nCoach: Okay, so that that would be the connecting for the opening of this conversation. Once you're really into it, if he were to turn to you and ask you, \"Jun, what's important to you about our future working relationship? What do you need?\", how would you answer that question?\n\nClient: That probably would be easier because the problem is quite obvious for me. I would just say from my heart that I would appreciate some more transparency about budget, about decisions, how decisions are made, if there's obstacles I would like to hear about that as well because then we would know that it's not that you're not doing it, it's just that there are things that are difficult to change. I would definitely appreciate some more support too.\n\nCoach: Okay, so when you say transparency, what would that look like, or what would that mean for you?\n\nClient: That would mean sharing not only the results, but also the process because I find sometimes he tends to share the good news but if something is not moving forwards, he has a habit of not sharing what's happening and people are just waiting anxiously. And I think also particularly on the budget side of things, it's also kind of a mystery to a lot us. And when we ask about this he says that there's no money, but at the end of the day, there's always money coming in.\n\nCoach: Okay. So some more continuous communication, more sharing about the process, and the influences on that process as things unfold rather than waiting until the end?\n\nClient: Yeah, absolutely, because this information will be important for us because then we can also use this information when we're working with our clients because sometimes our clients expect things to be done and we can't get them done for certain reasons that we don't know, so it's hard for us to communicate and build trust with our clients.\n\nCoach: So that greater transparency would allow you to do a better job for yourself, for your clients, and for the team overall?\n\nClient: Absolutely.\n\nCoach: Okay, so he might not ask you that question, but that doesn't mean that you can't still tell him that", "doc_id": "7f5b9c1a-1e9e-494e-a10c-027d37379980", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "59fa64fdb331e6565228b43457decbf7f7d0338b74a05b9b46d9b3f0728520dd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7336, "end": 11401}, "relationships": {"1": "0f7eca4e-c028-473f-83a7-ce8f61920fd4", "2": "60330c06-07e1-4672-ad85-41ea99ae8a7b", "3": "7be12e23-bfb0-4e8c-a1a3-d31a8ae50973"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7be12e23-bfb0-4e8c-a1a3-d31a8ae50973": {"__data__": {"text": "but at the end of the day, there's always money coming in.\n\nCoach: Okay.

What do you believe his answer to that question would be if you were to ask him what's important to you about our future working relationship? What do you think he would say?\n\nClient: He probably also wants more transparency. You know, people being more open about their feelings because to me he is a quite an easy-going person but he just sometimes has a habit of not sharing or being too busy. So I think he would also appreciate a bit more transparency from me and us. To keep him in the loop about what's happening and what's going on.\n\nCoach: Okay, so it would be important to ask him that question because we don't know, really, until we ask and we hear what their response is. What else would you want to know, from him, if anything?\n\nClient: I probably will ask him how he feels about the team. You know, if he has any concerns. I think that's where I will start because if he's detecting that there's a lack of trust then this is a good time for me to ask these questions.\n\nCoach: Okay, what kind of question do you think you might follow up with?\n\nClient: \"How do you want to see the team to improve?\", I guess, and \"What kind of a relationship do you want to build with the team?\" Or maybe ask him what some of the goals he has in mind are for the short-term and long-term.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********\n\nCoach: Good. So if you were to think about this conversation going really well up to this point, what do you think some tangible agreements could be that would help you to increase transparency, increase trust, and increase that level of support?\n\nClient: I think that because this conversation is between the two of us, I'm not sure if I have a very clear idea about measurable actions or if I should put this on him. But ideally if it goes well, hopefully he'll be sharing more information in our team meetings and be a little more vulnerable rather than just delivering the good news. And also look at projects a little more closely when needed, but not every time. Now that I said that I don't think it's just him, I think the team needs to reach out to him when needed and not be afraid to ask for support too.\n\nCoach: Okay, so it sounds like some of that agreement could be built into your team meetings?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: How else could it be structured?\n\nClient: Well other than team meetings, probably on a personal level, right? Because I think a big thing that I didn't say out loud is the trust between him and each individual. I think he could use more 1-on-1 time and for him to ask each individual about their projects, their feelings, their needs, their personal development to build trust with us individually. And then hopefully people will be more open to share things.\n\nCoach: Okay. So if you reflect on what we've discussed so far, the invitation, it sounds like you're in a positive frame of mind and you have positive intent to address this situation with him. You've got a good opening statement about wanting to talk about recent experiences and working with projects. You've also got some important needs and points to bring forward around wanting to increase trust, support, communication, and transparency. And then you have some pretty specific ideas about how that could happen, both in team and individual meetings. Finally, the kind of sharing", "doc_id": "7be12e23-bfb0-4e8c-a1a3-d31a8ae50973", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2b161098c82de012a4f6557fed3ca3bd8f2dc2cdbad44f8a16e273ad6ae13f8f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11329, "end": 15590}, "relationships": {"1": "0f7eca4e-c028-473f-83a7-ce8f61920fd4", "2": "7f5b9c1a-1e9e-494e-a10c-027d37379980", "3": "064db0c7-36a5-42c1-8e64-34a57889a782"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "064db0c7-36a5-42c1-8e64-34a57889a782": {"__data__": {"text": "thing that I didn't say out loud is the trust between him and each individual.

Finally, the kind of sharing of the process and influences on the process rather than just the results.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: How prepared do you feel now to take on this conversation with him?\n\nClient: I certainly feel a little bit more confident about how I could approach them, and what type of questions that I could ask and imagining what his response might be to the questions. I think that helps. I'm just still not sure if I want to be the first one to bring up this conversation, because usually that's a little bit scary.\n\nCoach: How will you know if you want to be the first one? What will help you make up your mind?\n\nClient: If I know our conversation will happen in more of a non-work setting and if he himself seems to also be asking these sorts of questions, then I could just open up. If he actually needs this sort of information. He needs to know, he wants to know, he expressed an interest in understanding then I think it will be the best way for me to open up.\n\nCoach: Okay. How often does he ask for that kind of information?\n\nClient: Probably not a lot. I mean, sometimes when we go for teams day usually there's a social part of it. Then it seems to happen a little more often. He talks more about feelings and what's happening.\n\nCoach: So maybe something to watch out for will be opportunities for opening the conversation. If you're watching out for them, maybe they'll actually be more of them than you might imagine.\n\nClient: Perhaps. Yes, we do have teams day and the occasional hangout or dine-out. Yeah, I should definitely keep that in mind and see when he's more open to this type of conversation in the last stretch.\n\nCoach: Yeah, look for a time that's not in the heat of the moment when it's a little more calm. So I would encourage you to print out this or download this conversation. Look for the places where you feel like you've got insight and understanding about yourselves and about him. Practice those phrases, memorize those questions, and look for an opportunity to open the conversation.\n\nClient: Will do. Thank you for your help today.\n\nCoach: You're welcome. The final phase of our collaborative conversation model is the reflection phase. So once you've had the conversation. Come back and let's chat about that.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 5: REFLECTION *********\n\nCoach: Welcome back, Jun. I guess you've had a chance to chat with your boss.\n\nClient: I did. Just yesterday we had a big team meeting and we were sipping some champagne actually and yeah, we talked about it.\n\nCoach: How did it go?\n\nClient: It was easier than I thought. When I said, \"Hey, you know I have respect for you and I just wanna share some things that are going on\", he's like, \"Oh yeah, let's talk about it\". So it went well.\n\nCoach: Great. What were you able to agree on?\n\nClient: I mean, I think he noticed that there's some unshared feelings among the team, and he said he will definitely be much more transparent because that's very easy for him to do. He didn't even know that that's something that the team wants, he thought that being a strong leader means bringing good news all the time.

How well do you think you handled your end of the conversation?\n\nClient: I felt relaxed that day, so I approached him in a very casual setting that wasn't super work-related so I definitely don't think I offended him in any way. I think he appreciated my thoughts, but of course I still felt a little bit scared so it took me some courage to actually say it. But I think overall he is very open to what I have to say now.\n\nCoach: Fantastic. What have you learned from this conversation that you would apply to future conversations in different situations?\n\nClient: I think definitely, when you approach a conversation, it's a good idea to think about the timing and the place because it actually has a lot of impact on the intensity of the conversation because at the workplace everything is quite tight, so that's definitely something I'll consider. And then how I approach them, the intention part, I think really helped because I told him that I want to share this because I want to see us working together more closely and building the working relationship with the entire team too. I think because the intention was shared, he didn't see this as a personal attack.\n\nCoach: Great. What would you do differently next time, if anything?\n\nClient: Nothing I think of right now. Well, I mean, of course he didn't tell me about anything I might be doing wrong so maybe I should ask for feedback from him, ask him how he felt about our conversation and if there's anything I can improve too. So that's probably something I can do next time.\n\nCoach: Okay, and how comfortable do you think you'll feel, if things start to go off the rails, to address it?\n\nClient: I don't know.\n\nCoach: Okay, well, you can always come back and have a chat with me.\n\nClient: Okay, will do. Thank you.\n\nCoach: Thanks, Jun.\n", "doc_id": "2b8eda3a-7427-4081-b310-0d24d3d8bd35", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bcb7ff22486dea714665c15db13a9beb3430f3a6fd939edd88dc646e76901203", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19604, "end": 22312}, "relationships": {"1": "0f7eca4e-c028-473f-83a7-ce8f61920fd4", "2": "064db0c7-36a5-42c1-8e64-34a57889a782"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b103af4d-5cf6-491d-ac5b-01b90ec9007f": {"__data__": {"text": "********* STAGE 1: INVITATION *********\n\nCoach: Hi Brianna, how are things going today?\n\nClient: They're okay. I'm having some problems with my roommate because they haven't been paying their rent on time.\n\nCoach: Okay. So tell me what's happening there.\n\nClient: So it's been about a month since their rent. Their share of the rent was due, and I've been waiting, and they keep telling me that they're gonna pay it but it's not happening. I'm just feeling really stressed out.\n\nCoach: Okay. And what have you done so far to try to resolve this, if anything?\n\nClient: I've spoken to them a couple times, just asking if they have any plans to pay it, and they tell me that they were working on getting a loan, but there hasn't been any progress.\n\nCoach: Okay. So you've tried, but you're not getting anything different?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: So how are you feeling about this?\n\nClient: I'm feeling really stressed because, you know, we live in a expensive place, and I don't have the money to cover their share of the rent. Especially since the next rent payment is coming up, and I'm really worried that they're not gonna be able to pay that, so then I'll have to cover for 2 months worth of rent payments.\n\nCoach: Okay, so you're feeling stressed. How else are you feeling?\n\nClient: I'm feeling anxious about having to have a difficult conversation with them.\n\nCoach: How strongly are you feeling these emotions?\n\nClient: Pretty strongly, and it feels like it's just getting worse as time passes.\n\nCoach: Okay, and how do you believe your roommate's feeling about it?\n\nClient: I think they're probably stressed as well, but I hope they're stressed enough to make them want to work on it.\n\nCoach: So if you're both feeling stressed and you're both living together, how is that impacting your relationship?\n\nClient: I think we had a good friendship, but it seems like we're avoiding each other now, and we just kind of go to our separate rooms when we get home.\n\nCoach: Okay, so that sounds like something you'd want to change. Not only the situation with the rent, but also the situation with how you're feeling being in the same space together.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: So, how do you think you could describe the situation to your roommate in a way that they could hear it differently than how you've tried it before?\n\nClient: I think maybe instead of sugarcoating it, I want to get straight to the point and let them know how it's affecting me. So instead of simply just asking them when they're planning on paying the rent, try to explain why it's causing me so much stress.\n\nCoach: So you're able to say that to me. Do you think you'd be able to use the same words with your roommate?\n\nClient: I think that's one of the things I'm worried about. I don't want to ruin our good friendship by upsetting them or making them feel guilty. But I also want something to change.\n\nCoach: And if you were to say that exact same thing to them, how do you think they would hear it?\n\nClient: I think it's hard predict because I haven't known them for that long, so I'm worried. They could be understanding, or they might feel upset and yell at me.\n\nCoach: Okay. So how do you think you could invite them into the conversation in a way that will help create safety for them?\n\nClient: Maybe I could ask them to just chat in the living room, in like a comfy area on the couch after a day at work or school.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********\n\nCoach: You use the words \"I'm stressed\" and \"I don't want to upset you\", and \"I need things to change\". If you were to say that to your roommate, how accurate do you think that would be?\n\nClient: I think, very accurate.\n\nCoach: What's the worst thing they could say?\n\nClient: They could start crying and start talking about", "doc_id": "b103af4d-5cf6-491d-ac5b-01b90ec9007f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "df48b5d71297e9beaf56f937f672fac1a58120062e577cdddbf79e595615cead", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3761}, "relationships": {"1": "3a43390c-449e-49c9-836b-59b8ec7b4ba8", "3": "6c9b7a59-5ee3-4d2d-8b5b-07115c98ebc0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c9b7a59-5ee3-4d2d-8b5b-07115c98ebc0": {"__data__": {"text": "long, so I'm worried.

How do you hope the conversation would unfold between you?\n\nClient: I'd hope it would remain calm and emotions remain level between the both of us. But I also hope things would change, and rent would obviously be paid, or at least a set plan to pay the rent would unfold.\n\nCoach: Okay. So all of that sounds like it's important for you to be able to convey to your roommate.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: Good. So, what's important to you in this situation? What would be important to be achieved in a good outcome?\n\nClient: I think, other than the plan, I really would like to maintain a friendship with my roommate, or at least keep some level of friendliness there and not have any tension, because we do live together.\n\nCoach: Okay. So aside from the plan, you also want a supportive and friendly home atmosphere?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: And what would the plan address?\n\nClient: I think it would address the plan to pay off the recent payments, but also a plan to avoid this situation in the future.\n\nCoach: Okay, and if you were to ask your roommate what would be important to them, what do you think they would say?\n\nClient: I think they would say the same thing, because I'm sure it's stressful for them not being able to pay their share of their rent, and having this loom over them. So yeah, I think they would say something similar.\n\nCoach: What else would you like to know from their point of view?\n\nClient: I think I would like to know exactly what they've been working on this whole time that the rent hasn't been paid, and how it is affecting them. Just so I don't feel like they just don't care.\n\nCoach: Right. So that would be an important question to ask.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********\n\nCoach: Okay.

So if this conversation goes really well, and you agree on a plan, what do you think some aspects of that plan might entail? What could actually be created in terms of an agreement between you that would be satisfying for you?\n\nClient: I hope for the future that they would find another source for the money, at least temporarily. Whether it be through help of a parent or something like that, just so that they can get it in. And then for the previously due payment, I suppose it would be the same solution.\n\nCoach: So that you have some assurance and some predictability that the bills will be paid on time?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: Okay. And what do you think you might be able to do to contribute to a good outcome?\n\nClient: I think, like, I said, just remaining calm and coming from a place of understanding, but also trying to get my point across and maybe I can offer to help them come up with a plan.\n\nCoach: Okay. So we've talked about how you're feeling about this situation and how you think they are feeling about it. We talked about how you could invite them into the conversation using words and phrases that will create safety and still get your point across. And you've talked about what's important to you and what you believe is important to them about the situation, both in terms of the finances and the rent and your home environment. How prepared do you feel now? Do you feel like you are now ready to start this conversation with them, should the opportunity arise?\n\nClient: I think I'm much better prepared than I was at the beginning for sure.\n\nCoach: Okay. So I'd encourage you to download this conversation or save it. Read through it for the words and questions and phrases that are the most meaningful for you, that create curiosity, that create clarity and empathy, and that help you structure your conversation in a way that you feel will be inviting and safe for everyone. Once you've had the conversation, come back and let's reflect on it.\n\nClient: Okay. Thank you.\n\nCoach: You're welcome. Good luck!\n\n\n\n********* PHASE 5: REFLECTION *********\n\nCoach: So, Brianna, you've had your conversation. How did it go?\n\nClient: I think it went well. I feel like I was worried for nothing. She took it really well. I'm still a bit worried because nothing changed right away but, like we discussed, we do have a plan in place.\n\nCoach: Okay, and how do you feel about that plan?\n\nClient: I feel pretty good. It's not 100% bulletproof, but I think it should work.\n\nCoach: How do you think they feel about the plan?\n\nClient: They seem to feel better from what I can tell, less stressed. They actually were worried that I was really mad and was going to yell at them. So I think they also feel relieved.\n\nCoach: That's really good to hear. What did you do well in the conversation? What did you learn that you could do well?\n\nClient: I think remaining calm and coming from that place of understanding really helped me, and not just talking about how I feel, but trying to understand how they feel. I think they felt safer.\n\nCoach: Uh huh. What would you do differently if anything? And why?\n\nClient: I think the only thing I would do differently is, do this a lot sooner, and not put it off for so long.\n\nCoach: And", "doc_id": "810cb27c-f0ec-4a80-a90f-0c2b788b2c5d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e76bf74b3efeaf9f5c53bf16a132b574a8da24c97663b40b908c893cce1c553d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 6903, "end": 10800}, "relationships": {"1": "3a43390c-449e-49c9-836b-59b8ec7b4ba8", "2": "6c9b7a59-5ee3-4d2d-8b5b-07115c98ebc0", "3": "598d09bd-819a-4b93-8dff-5b2723e19b0b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "598d09bd-819a-4b93-8dff-5b2723e19b0b": {"__data__": {"text": "How do you think they feel about the plan?\n\nClient: They seem to feel better from what I can tell, less stressed.

I'm feeling frustrated at work, for sure.\n\nCoach: Okay, so tell me what's happening.\n\nClient: Well, where do I begin? So, I don't like my boss right? And a lot of people in my office don't like him either because he doesn't give a lot of direction and support to us, yet he feels like we have to take workshops to improve our time management skills. I'm just not comfortable with this whole thing and I'm not sure how to tell him that it's probably also you, not just us.\n\nCoach: What have you tried so far to approach this situation?\n\nClient: I haven't, that's the thing. I'm not sure if I should approach him. My boss did ask my feelings towards the workshop, but he didn't realize he could be the problem. I'm struggling here, right? My colleagues have been talking about shit. But I'm just not sure so I haven't done much.\n\nCoach: Okay, so what's kept you from trying to resolve it?\n\nClient: Yeah, that's a really good question. I'm scared, honestly, I mean it's my boss, and you know my future sort of depends on him. If I say something that's out of my lane, I'm not sure if I would still be seen as a good employee or a good person in the workplace. I mean, my colleagues have been talking shit, but I don't know if I want to be the one who brings the bad news to him. I'm not sure if I have the power to say that and I'm scared about the consequences.\n\nCoach: You're feeling like it could be risky to bring it up.\n\nClient: Yeah, for sure.\n\nCoach: How strongly are you feeling about this right now?\n\nClient: I mean I personally don't think it's that bad, but because it's being talked about in the entire office, on one hand I think we should tell him because I think he needs to know that people are feeling this way. But on the other hand I have some personal feelings towards the situation. I occasionally feel like he needs to be more transparent and needs to provide more directions. So I feel like I should talk to him.\n\nCoach: Okay. So it sounds like you're getting yourself ready to have that kind of conversation with him.\n\nClient: Yeah, but it's about how. I mean, I have some good ideas in my mind about what to say, but I just can't bring up the courage to actually tell him.\n\nCoach: Okay, well, let's work on it together. How does that sound?\n\nClient: Okay.\n\nCoach: Okay. So how do you believe your boss is feeling about the situation?\n\nClient: I imagine he could probably sense something, right? If people are talking behind his back. I'm not sure. I think he probably knows something's going on, but not sure, and there's probably not a lot of opportunities to ask. Maybe he also feels awkward about it or scared to find out the truth, I guess.\n\nCoach: Okay, so it sounds like you want to make improvements to the working relationship, not only between you and him but also between him and the rest of the team.\n\nClient: Absolutely. I think it's important for us to have a good working relationship as a team because that's how we improve and how we feel safe. Because otherwise, you feel like people are not trusting him and the work is not getting done properly. Yeah, it's not great.\n\nCoach: Okay. So from what you're telling me so far, it sounds like you have some pretty positive intentions around this conversation and that's a really great place to start. So let's think about how we might actually start this conversation with your boss. So if you were to think about describing the problem to him, how would you describe it?\n\nClient: Hmm! That's a hard one! English is my second language, so I'm not sure if the words I choose are appropriate or not or if I'm being sensitive enough or not. Hopefully I will frame it around trust, I think that would probably be a good place to start.\n\nCoach: So trust is certainly something you want to build into your future", "doc_id": "584213f3-3235-41bb-9dc9-8bfe4630cfaf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "005e745d9bd36d67ea6bd354df8a5626dad9318af506ce2823ad146d423795ba", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3899, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "fea30c2d-5347-4ff3-a6ea-22d7982830ab", "3": "d7cc536a-40af-4d83-90eb-84f92a493ba5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7cc536a-40af-4d83-90eb-84f92a493ba5": {"__data__": {"text": "to start.\n\nCoach: So trust is certainly something you want to build into your future working relationship. If you were to go to him and say, \"I'd like to talk about trust\", how do you think he would respond to that?\n\nClient: I don't know. I think now that you said it, I think it's all quite strong, so maybe I should change it a little bit and say \"I just want to talk about what's happened lately to some of the projects and my feelings\", maybe that's a good place to start instead of just going to trust right away?\n\nCoach: So you could talk about some recent experience, or about working together?\n\nClient: Yes, I think that's a good place to start.\n\nCoach: Okay, and then how do you think he might respond to that if you were to say that?\n\nClient: I think he'll be very open to it because that's something we talk about all the time anyways. So, I could say \"I want to chat about some of the projects\", and he'd be very open to it.\n\nCoach: Okay, good. So that might be a good opening invitation to connect. \"Hey, I'd like to talk to you about some recent experience working on the projects together\".\n\nClient: Yeah, that'd be a great place to start.\n\nCoach: Good. So when you think about this problem, what role do you think you might have played in actually creating it?\n\nClient: I mean I for sure didn't tell him how everyone feels and also of course I'm probably not telling him how I feel sometimes and he's not necessarily aware of our feelings. I think that's probably the main thing.\n\nCoach: So, if you were to share with him why you haven't brought this up in the past, or what role you might have played in getting to where you are now, how do you think he would respond to that?\n\nClient: If I said that I feel like I didn't tell you how I feel, I think he'd be happy, right? Because if someone is taking the courage to share their feelings, I think he'd appreciate it.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********\n\nCoach: And then what else do you think you might be able to say in that first connecting conversation, right at the beginning, that would help create a sense of safety and comfort for him to join you in that conversation?\n\nClient: I think things like my intention, you know I'm not here to complain but to help us to move forward and really just explain what my intentions are and how I've been struggling with this. I'm not sure if I should tell him because of my concerns. I think my intentions and concerns would be helpful.\n\nCoach: And then he'd likely want to know what the problem is. How do you think you can describe the problem in a way that he can hear it?\n\nClient: That's the hardest part. It's a harsh truth, and I might need to be sensitive about it. I haven't found the right phrasing but if I try, it would probably be something like, \"Hey, I notice that people have some feelings that they have to share with you, and I think it is in the way of a good working relationship\".\n\nCoach: Okay, I like that and I would encourage you to speak from your own perspective rather than saying \"people\", and there's a reason for that. Because you are the one that is going to have the conversation with him, and the danger of saying \"we\" is that he could feel like he is being ganged up on. So if you speak from your own perspective, I think it would be easier for him to have this conversation rather than feeling like he's having a conversation with not only you, but also people who are not in the room.\n\nClient: Right, and no one wants to feel like they're being ganged up on.\n\nCoach: What do you think about what I'm saying?\n\nClient: Okay, that makes sense, but at the same time it puts me in the hot seat because he could say \"Oh, I've never heard this from anyone else, so maybe it's just you\".\n\nCoach: So how would you respond if he did say that?\n\nClient: \"Maybe people are too scared\"? I'm not sure.\n\nCoach: What do you think would be the easiest for him to hear?\n\nClient: \"Maybe I'm the first one who had the", "doc_id": "d7cc536a-40af-4d83-90eb-84f92a493ba5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "189051f6e2b32edcb3804aaeb12c63983ce500220d4cea57ae73d5bcf22f1135", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3829, "end": 7779, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "fea30c2d-5347-4ff3-a6ea-22d7982830ab", "2": "584213f3-3235-41bb-9dc9-8bfe4630cfaf", "3": "f194cb0f-9bc7-4d9e-9979-4feec61b19a7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f194cb0f-9bc7-4d9e-9979-4feec61b19a7": {"__data__": {"text": "for him to hear?\n\nClient: \"Maybe I'm the first one who had the courage to tell you\"?\n\nCoach: And that sounds like it might be true.\n\nClient: It is true, yeah. Or maybe he's heard this already. Or he has a concern and he feels validated because he knows something is going on.\n\nCoach: So part of the art of having these kinds of conversations is that we don't know what the other person will say, and at the same time it's kind of good to think about what they might say so that we have thought through and considered a respectful response that is true for you.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 3: EXCHANGE *********\n\nCoach: Okay, so that that would be the connecting for the opening of this conversation. Once you're really into it, if he were to turn to you and ask you, \"Jun, what's important to you about our future working relationship? What do you need?\", how would you answer that question?\n\nClient: That probably would be easier because the problem is quite obvious for me. I would just say from my heart that I would appreciate some more transparency about budget, about decisions, how decisions are made, if there's obstacles I would like to hear about that as well because then we would know that it's not that you're not doing it, it's just that there are things that are difficult to change. I would definitely appreciate some more support too.\n\nCoach: Okay, so when you say transparency, what would that look like, or what would that mean for you?\n\nClient: That would mean sharing not only the results, but also the process because I find sometimes he tends to share the good news but if something is not moving forwards, he has a habit of not sharing what's happening and people are just waiting anxiously. And I think also particularly on the budget side of things, it's also kind of a mystery to a lot us. And when we ask about this he says that there's no money, but at the end of the day, there's always money coming in.\n\nCoach: Okay. So some more continuous communication, more sharing about the process, and the influences on that process as things unfold rather than waiting until the end?\n\nClient: Yeah, absolutely, because this information will be important for us because then we can also use this information when we're working with our clients because sometimes our clients expect things to be done and we can't get them done for certain reasons that we don't know, so it's hard for us to communicate and build trust with our clients.\n\nCoach: So that greater transparency would allow you to do a better job for yourself, for your clients, and for the team overall?\n\nClient: Absolutely.\n\nCoach: Okay, so he might not ask you that question, but that doesn't mean that you can't still tell him that because that's still a really valid and important point and the way you phrased it is still quite respectful. What do you believe his answer to that question would be if you were to ask him what's important to you about our future working relationship? What do you think he would say?\n\nClient: He probably also wants more transparency. You know, people being more open about their feelings because to me he is a quite an easy-going person but he just sometimes has a habit of not sharing or being too busy. So I think he would also appreciate a bit more transparency from me and us. To keep him in the loop about what's happening and what's going on.\n\nCoach: Okay, so it would be important to ask him that question because we don't know, really, until we ask and we hear what their response is. What else would you want to know, from him, if anything?\n\nClient: I probably will ask him how he feels about the team. You know, if he has any concerns. I think that's where I will start because if he's detecting that there's a lack of trust then this is a good time for me to ask these questions.\n\nCoach: Okay, what kind of question do you think you might follow up with?\n\nClient: \"How do you want to see the team to improve?\", I guess, and \"What kind of a relationship do you want to build with the team?\" Or maybe ask him what some of the goals he has in mind are for the short-term and long-term.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT", "doc_id": "f194cb0f-9bc7-4d9e-9979-4feec61b19a7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "19f30e4c04e532854b67a10dd00242bcb7ff8a42fa032237cc756f7364061a0b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7800, "end": 11935, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "fea30c2d-5347-4ff3-a6ea-22d7982830ab", "2": "d7cc536a-40af-4d83-90eb-84f92a493ba5", "3": "4846ddec-22a8-4aa8-81ed-d52ae834cdc2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4846ddec-22a8-4aa8-81ed-d52ae834cdc2": {"__data__": {"text": "short-term and long-term.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********\n\nCoach: Good. So if you were to think about this conversation going really well up to this point, what do you think some tangible agreements could be that would help you to increase transparency, increase trust, and increase that level of support?\n\nClient: I think that because this conversation is between the two of us, I'm not sure if I have a very clear idea about measurable actions or if I should put this on him. But ideally if it goes well, hopefully he'll be sharing more information in our team meetings and be a little more vulnerable rather than just delivering the good news. And also look at projects a little more closely when needed, but not every time. Now that I said that I don't think it's just him, I think the team needs to reach out to him when needed and not be afraid to ask for support too.\n\nCoach: Okay, so it sounds like some of that agreement could be built into your team meetings?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: How else could it be structured?\n\nClient: Well other than team meetings, probably on a personal level, right? Because I think a big thing that I didn't say out loud is the trust between him and each individual. I think he could use more 1-on-1 time and for him to ask each individual about their projects, their feelings, their needs, their personal development to build trust with us individually. And then hopefully people will be more open to share things.\n\nCoach: Okay. So if you reflect on what we've discussed so far, the invitation, it sounds like you're in a positive frame of mind and you have positive intent to address this situation with him. You've got a good opening statement about wanting to talk about recent experiences and working with projects. You've also got some important needs and points to bring forward around wanting to increase trust, support, communication, and transparency. And then you have some pretty specific ideas about how that could happen, both in team and individual meetings. Finally, the kind of sharing of the process and influences on the process rather than just the results.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: How prepared do you feel now to take on this conversation with him?\n\nClient: I certainly feel a little bit more confident about how I could approach them, and what type of questions that I could ask and imagining what his response might be to the questions. I think that helps. I'm just still not sure if I want to be the first one to bring up this conversation, because usually that's a little bit scary.\n\nCoach: How will you know if you want to be the first one? What will help you make up your mind?\n\nClient: If I know our conversation will happen in more of a non-work setting and if he himself seems to also be asking these sorts of questions, then I could just open up. If he actually needs this sort of information. He needs to know, he wants to know, he expressed an interest in understanding then I think it will be the best way for me to open up.\n\nCoach: Okay. How often does he ask for that kind of information?\n\nClient: Probably not a lot. I mean, sometimes when we go for teams day usually there's a social part of it. Then it seems to happen a little more often. He talks more about feelings and what's happening.\n\nCoach: So maybe something to watch out for will be opportunities for opening the conversation. If you're watching out for them, maybe they'll actually be more of them than you might imagine.\n\nClient: Perhaps. Yes, we do have teams day and the occasional hangout or dine-out. Yeah, I should definitely keep that in mind and see when he's more open to this type of conversation in the last stretch.\n\nCoach: Yeah, look for a time that's not in the heat of the moment when it's a little more calm. So I would encourage you to print out this or download this conversation. Look for the places where you feel like you've got insight and understanding about yourselves and about him. Practice those phrases, memorize those questions, and look for an opportunity to open the conversation.\n\nClient: Will do. Thank you for your help today.\n\nCoach: You're welcome.

Thank you for your help today.\n\nCoach: You're welcome. The final phase of our collaborative conversation model is the reflection phase. So once you've had the conversation. Come back and let's chat about that.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 5: REFLECTION *********\n\nCoach: Welcome back, Jun. I guess you've had a chance to chat with your boss.\n\nClient: I did. Just yesterday we had a big team meeting and we were sipping some champagne actually and yeah, we talked about it.\n\nCoach: How did it go?\n\nClient: It was easier than I thought. When I said, \"Hey, you know I have respect for you and I just wanna share some things that are going on\", he's like, \"Oh yeah, let's talk about it\". So it went well.\n\nCoach: Great. What were you able to agree on?\n\nClient: I mean, I think he noticed that there's some unshared feelings among the team, and he said he will definitely be much more transparent because that's very easy for him to do. He didn't even know that that's something that the team wants, he thought that being a strong leader means bringing good news all the time. He didn't realize that the team wanted to hear more about the process and sometimes there's not a lot of time in our meetings, so in the future he could schedule a bit more time for information-sharing.\n\nCoach: Good. How well do you think you handled your end of the conversation?\n\nClient: I felt relaxed that day, so I approached him in a very casual setting that wasn't super work-related so I definitely don't think I offended him in any way. I think he appreciated my thoughts, but of course I still felt a little bit scared so it took me some courage to actually say it. But I think overall he is very open to what I have to say now.\n\nCoach: Fantastic. What have you learned from this conversation that you would apply to future conversations in different situations?\n\nClient: I think definitely, when you approach a conversation, it's a good idea to think about the timing and the place because it actually has a lot of impact on the intensity of the conversation because at the workplace everything is quite tight, so that's definitely something I'll consider. And then how I approach them, the intention part, I think really helped because I told him that I want to share this because I want to see us working together more closely and building the working relationship with the entire team too. I think because the intention was shared, he didn't see this as a personal attack.\n\nCoach: Great. What would you do differently next time, if anything?\n\nClient: Nothing I think of right now. Well, I mean, of course he didn't tell me about anything I might be doing wrong so maybe I should ask for feedback from him, ask him how he felt about our conversation and if there's anything I can improve too. So that's probably something I can do next time.\n\nCoach: Okay, and how comfortable do you think you'll feel, if things start to go off the rails, to address it?\n\nClient: I don't know.\n\nCoach: Okay, well, you can always come back and have a chat with me.\n\nClient: Okay, will do.

I'm having some problems with my roommate because they haven't been paying their rent on time.\n\nCoach: Okay. So tell me what's happening there.\n\nClient: So it's been about a month since their rent. Their share of the rent was due, and I've been waiting, and they keep telling me that they're gonna pay it but it's not happening. I'm just feeling really stressed out.\n\nCoach: Okay. And what have you done so far to try to resolve this, if anything?\n\nClient: I've spoken to them a couple times, just asking if they have any plans to pay it, and they tell me that they were working on getting a loan, but there hasn't been any progress.\n\nCoach: Okay. So you've tried, but you're not getting anything different?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: So how are you feeling about this?\n\nClient: I'm feeling really stressed because, you know, we live in a expensive place, and I don't have the money to cover their share of the rent. Especially since the next rent payment is coming up, and I'm really worried that they're not gonna be able to pay that, so then I'll have to cover for 2 months worth of rent payments.\n\nCoach: Okay, so you're feeling stressed. How else are you feeling?\n\nClient: I'm feeling anxious about having to have a difficult conversation with them.\n\nCoach: How strongly are you feeling these emotions?\n\nClient: Pretty strongly, and it feels like it's just getting worse as time passes.\n\nCoach: Okay, and how do you believe your roommate's feeling about it?\n\nClient: I think they're probably stressed as well, but I hope they're stressed enough to make them want to work on it.\n\nCoach: So if you're both feeling stressed and you're both living together, how is that impacting your relationship?\n\nClient: I think we had a good friendship, but it seems like we're avoiding each other now, and we just kind of go to our separate rooms when we get home.\n\nCoach: Okay, so that sounds like something you'd want to change. Not only the situation with the rent, but also the situation with how you're feeling being in the same space together.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: So, how do you think you could describe the situation to your roommate in a way that they could hear it differently than how you've tried it before?\n\nClient: I think maybe instead of sugarcoating it, I want to get straight to the point and let them know how it's affecting me. So instead of simply just asking them when they're planning on paying the rent, try to explain why it's causing me so much stress.\n\nCoach: So you're able to say that to me. Do you think you'd be able to use the same words with your roommate?\n\nClient: I think that's one of the things I'm worried about. I don't want to ruin our good friendship by upsetting them or making them feel guilty. But I also want something to change.\n\nCoach: And if you were to say that exact same thing to them, how do you think they would hear it?\n\nClient: I think it's hard predict because I haven't known them for that long, so I'm worried. They could be understanding, or they might feel upset and yell at me.\n\nCoach: Okay. So how do you think you could invite them into the conversation in a way that will help create safety for them?\n\nClient: Maybe I could ask them to just chat in the living room, in like a comfy area on the couch after a day at work or school.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********\n\nCoach: You use the words \"I'm stressed\" and \"I don't want to upset you\", and \"I need things to change\". If you were to say that to your roommate, how accurate do you think that would be?\n\nClient: I think, very accurate.\n\nCoach: What's the worst thing they could say?\n\nClient: They could start crying and start talking about", "doc_id": "efd5309a-f5f7-4316-8d32-8887889d1e12", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "df48b5d71297e9beaf56f937f672fac1a58120062e577cdddbf79e595615cead", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3761, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0df5b545-92c7-45cf-b025-7c60d181bfa1", "3": "d3fea5e6-fa93-4338-b7ac-a60318dc59f1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3fea5e6-fa93-4338-b7ac-a60318dc59f1": {"__data__": {"text": "the worst thing they could say?\n\nClient: They could start crying and start talking about how stressed they are but not really consider my feelings.\n\nCoach: And how would that be for you if that happened?\n\nClient: I think that would be very upsetting for me as well, because I think in the past I've been quite a pushover, so I'm worried that I'll give in to their tactics.\n\nCoach: What do you think you could do in that situation if that were to occur that would help you stay true to your conversation?\n\nClient: I think, just try my best to remain calm and remind them that I understand where they're coming from, and I understand that they're stressed as well, but just reiterate that I'm also under stress from the situation.\n\nCoach: And if you're both stressed in the situation, that's not a place you wanna stay.\n\nClient: No!\n\nCoach: So you need to talk about it in order to move on.\n\nClient: I suppose so, yes.\n\nCoach: Okay, what else do you think could create safety for you and for the other person in having this conversation?\n\nClient: I think maybe I could just use friendly language.\n\nCoach: Okay, what would be an example of friendly language?\n\nClient: \"I hope you're doing well\", and... that's all I can really think of at the moment.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 3: EXCHANGE *********\n\nCoach: Okay, good. How do you hope the conversation would unfold between you?\n\nClient: I'd hope it would remain calm and emotions remain level between the both of us. But I also hope things would change, and rent would obviously be paid, or at least a set plan to pay the rent would unfold.\n\nCoach: Okay. So all of that sounds like it's important for you to be able to convey to your roommate.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: Good. So, what's important to you in this situation? What would be important to be achieved in a good outcome?\n\nClient: I think, other than the plan, I really would like to maintain a friendship with my roommate, or at least keep some level of friendliness there and not have any tension, because we do live together.\n\nCoach: Okay. So aside from the plan, you also want a supportive and friendly home atmosphere?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: And what would the plan address?\n\nClient: I think it would address the plan to pay off the recent payments, but also a plan to avoid this situation in the future.\n\nCoach: Okay, and if you were to ask your roommate what would be important to them, what do you think they would say?\n\nClient: I think they would say the same thing, because I'm sure it's stressful for them not being able to pay their share of their rent, and having this loom over them. So yeah, I think they would say something similar.\n\nCoach: What else would you like to know from their point of view?\n\nClient: I think I would like to know exactly what they've been working on this whole time that the rent hasn't been paid, and how it is affecting them. Just so I don't feel like they just don't care.\n\nCoach: Right. So that would be an important question to ask.\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********\n\nCoach: Okay. So if this conversation goes really well, and you agree on a plan, what do you think some aspects of that plan might entail? What could actually be created in terms of an agreement between you that would be satisfying for you?\n\nClient: I hope for the future that they would find another source for the money, at least temporarily. Whether it be through help of a parent or something like that, just so that they can get it in. And then for the previously due payment, I suppose it would be the same solution.\n\nCoach: So that you have some assurance and some predictability that the bills will be paid on time?\n\nClient: Yeah.\n\nCoach: Okay. And what do you think you might be able to do to contribute to a good outcome?\n\nClient: I think, like, I said, just remaining calm and coming from a place", "doc_id": "d3fea5e6-fa93-4338-b7ac-a60318dc59f1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c931835ce9a89c9e335124d4d6426d2edb0ced873ab4cdd9f329252d9e3dc7cf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3687, "end": 7526, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0df5b545-92c7-45cf-b025-7c60d181bfa1", "2": "efd5309a-f5f7-4316-8d32-8887889d1e12", "3": "0a5afe5f-a13c-43cb-a665-7276bcbc7d56"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a5afe5f-a13c-43cb-a665-7276bcbc7d56": {"__data__": {"text": "I think, like, I said, just remaining calm and coming from a place of understanding, but also trying to get my point across and maybe I can offer to help them come up with a plan.\n\nCoach: Okay. So we've talked about how you're feeling about this situation and how you think they are feeling about it. We talked about how you could invite them into the conversation using words and phrases that will create safety and still get your point across. And you've talked about what's important to you and what you believe is important to them about the situation, both in terms of the finances and the rent and your home environment. How prepared do you feel now? Do you feel like you are now ready to start this conversation with them, should the opportunity arise?\n\nClient: I think I'm much better prepared than I was at the beginning for sure.\n\nCoach: Okay. So I'd encourage you to download this conversation or save it. Read through it for the words and questions and phrases that are the most meaningful for you, that create curiosity, that create clarity and empathy, and that help you structure your conversation in a way that you feel will be inviting and safe for everyone. Once you've had the conversation, come back and let's reflect on it.\n\nClient: Okay. Thank you.\n\nCoach: You're welcome. Good luck!\n\n\n\n********* STAGE 5: REFLECTION *********\n\nCoach: So, Brianna, you've had your conversation. How did it go?\n\nClient: I think it went well. I feel like I was worried for nothing. She took it really well. I'm still a bit worried because nothing changed right away but, like we discussed, we do have a plan in place.\n\nCoach: Okay, and how do you feel about that plan?\n\nClient: I feel pretty good. It's not 100% bulletproof, but I think it should work.\n\nCoach: How do you think they feel about the plan?\n\nClient: They seem to feel better from what I can tell, less stressed. They actually were worried that I was really mad and was going to yell at them. So I think they also feel relieved.\n\nCoach: That's really good to hear. What did you do well in the conversation? What did you learn that you could do well?\n\nClient: I think remaining calm and coming from that place of understanding really helped me, and not just talking about how I feel, but trying to understand how they feel. I think they felt safer.\n\nCoach: Uh huh. What would you do differently if anything? And why?\n\nClient: I think the only thing I would do differently is, do this a lot sooner, and not put it off for so long.\n\nCoach: And what else have you learned in this situation that you could apply to future conversations with other people in different situations?\n\nClient: I think I now have the confidence in myself to be able to approach conflict in a more healthy way, and not be so worried about things that could go wrong, and taking preventative measures to make sure that things don't go wrong.\n\nCoach: That sounds like a good plan, and I'm always here to help you if you need it.\n\nClient: Okay. Thank you.\n\nCoach: It was my pleasure, Brianna.\n", "doc_id": "0a5afe5f-a13c-43cb-a665-7276bcbc7d56", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7580ee966e25e2342b3449de97bbd95aa133de108b416eb2cad4870279a9b340", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7535, "end": 10561, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0df5b545-92c7-45cf-b025-7c60d181bfa1", "2": "d3fea5e6-fa93-4338-b7ac-a60318dc59f1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae713060-7320-41f2-8d1f-2b967bcd7d39": {"__data__": {"text": "********* STAGE 1: INVITATION *********\nCoach: Hi there how are things going today?\nClient: Well honestly I\u2019m really stressed out. I'm having some problems with my coworker because they haven't been completing their tasks on time which means that I can\u2019t complete my tasks on time; I really need this job and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to get fired because of their laziness!.\nCoach: Sounds like this is situation is really important to you to resolve!  Tell me more about what\u2019s happening here. \nClient: So, for example, they were supposed to send me some statistics for a report I needed to do and without that, I couldn\u2019t write the conclusion. I asked them several times to send the stats but they keep giving me excuses and not delivering. My report is incomplete and so it\u2019s going to look bad for me. \nCoach: It sounds like this has happened a few times?\nClient: Yes \u2013 several times over the past 6 months. \nCoach: What have you done to try to resolve this problem?\nClient: I\u2019ve emailed and set up meetings trying to firm up dates to get the tasks done but they either cancel the meetings , or just tell me that they've been busy with other projects. When we do manage to nail down a deadline that pass and there  hasn't been any progress.\nCoach: So you have managed to have conversations that result in an agreed upon deadline but you\u2019re not seeing the results?\nClient: Yeah.\nCoach: You mentioned before you are feeling stressed out.  What other feelings are coming up for you around this situation?\nClient: Well like I said before, I'm feeling really stressed because it's impacting my own work and deadlines. It's frustrating to rely on someone who's not fulfilling their responsibilities.\nCoach: Okay, so you're feeling frustrated. How else are you feeling?\nClient: I\u2019m also disappointed with the situation. It's affecting the team's productivity and causing unnecessary delays. My work is important to me and I\u2019m failing! \nCoach: Sounds like you have some strong feelings about this situation. \nClient: Yes for sure and it's starting to affect my motivation and enthusiasm for my job.\nCoach: How do you think your coworker is feeling about it?\nClient: I think they might be feeling overwhelmed or disorganized, but I'm not sure how seriously they're taking the impact of their actions on the team.\nCoach: So if you're both feeling stressed and it's affecting the team's productivity, how is that impacting your working relationship?\nClient: I think there's a lack of trust and reliability now. It's harder to collaborate and depend on each other when there's a recurring issue like this.\nCoach: Sounds like it\u2019s important to you to figure out the situation with the incomplete tasks but also to change the the dynamics and effectiveness of your working relationship.\nClient: Yes definitely.\nCoach: So, how do you think you could approach the conversation with your coworker in a way that they could hear it differently than what you've tried it before?\nClient: Well maybe instead of forcing them to impose a deadline and just reminding them about the tasks, I could express the impact it's having on me and the team's success. I definitely want to be direct and professional.\nCoach: That sounds very clear. How would you feel about saying that to your coworker?\nClient: I think I could say that; I will need to choose my words carefully and express my concerns without attacking them. \nCoach: How do you think that would land for your coworker?\nClient: I think it's hard to predict their exact response, but I hope they would understand the seriousness of the situation and be open to finding a solution together.\nCoach: How ready do you think your coworker is to have a conversation about this issue?\nClient: Well considering how busy they are, they might not feel comfortable having this conversation now. \nCoach: How do you think you could invite them into the conversation in a way that will help create safety for them?\nClient: Maybe I could schedule", "doc_id": "ae713060-7320-41f2-8d1f-2b967bcd7d39", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "70da35400be3777d9959526307f90d548a71ab1f941d0da3cec83f5235d664af", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3965, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "30eb0e27-7d2e-43b6-a6f8-ee5ed0790158", "3": "b0a99909-f55e-4304-b4f0-ee76486669d1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0a99909-f55e-4304-b4f0-ee76486669d1": {"__data__": {"text": "in a way that will help create safety for them?\nClient: Maybe I could schedule a one-on-one meeting and frame it as an opportunity to discuss the project's progress and potential challenges. This way, they might feel more comfortable and open to addressing the issue.\nCoach: That sounds like a good approach. Setting up a dedicated meeting and framing the issue in a neutral way can definitely promote a collaborative approach.\n\n********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********\nCoach: So, it sounds like it\u2019s important to you to express to your coworker how the missed deadlines are impacting you as well as your intent to work together towards a solution. What is important to you to express to your coworker so they are clear on what the issue is for you?\nClient: I think I would say that I am feel stressed about deadlines not being met and I don't want to cause any distress for them either by setting deadlines that he can\u2019t make.\nCoach: How do you think that would land for your co-worker?\nClient: Well, based on our conversations in the past he might become defensive, and make excuses and then say that I'm overreacting or that it's not a big deal. \nCoach: I can imagine that would be hard to hear. How would you feel if he took that approach?\nClient: It would be really discouraging and make me doubt my own feelings and concerns. I think it would even escalate the conflict further.\nCoach: What could you do in that situation to help you stay true to your conversation?\nClient: I could try to stay calm and assertive, and reiterate that my feelings are valid and that I would appreciate if he could listen and understand where I'm coming from.\nCoach: That sounds like a good approach. What else do you think could create safety for you and your coworker in having this conversation?\nClient: I think it would help if we have enough time to talk without any interruptions. So maybe if I schedule the meeting later in the week \u2013 just after lunch tends to be a bit calmer than in the mornings. \nCoach: That's a great idea \u2013 it\u2019s important to set the conversation up in a good way.  How do you hope the conversation would unfold?\nClient: I hope that we can have a calm and honest conversation where we both listen to each other's perspectives without getting defensive. I would like to find a resolution that works for both of us and build a more positive working relationship between us.\nCoach: That sounds good.  How open do you feel to hear your coworker\u2019s perspective on this?\nClient: I think there\u2019s a lot going on for them and I\u2019d like to be able to support them in as well. It\u2019s important that we all work together!\nCoach: That is a very positive attitude and will go a long way in creating a collaborative space for you to have this conversation.  \n\n********* STAGE 3: EXCHANGE *********\nCoach: Based on what we've discussed, how would you like to start the conversation?\nClient: Well like I said before I think it\u2019s important that we have time to really talk this through and I want to approach the conversation in a non-confrontational manner. Maybe I could send a meeting request and say something like, \"I\u2019d like to set up a time for us to discuss how we work together to set timelines that work for both of us.\"\nCoach: It\u2019s important that you carve out time to have this conversation and that sounds like a good way to get things started. What specific points do you want to address during this conversation?\nClient: Well I definitely want to address the issue of missed deadlines and how stressed out it makes me as well as what that does to our team's overall performance. I think it\u2019s important to let them know that  their delays put additional pressure on us and impact our ability to meet project goals. I also want to make sure they know that I\u2019m here to support them and to better understand what\u2019s getting in their way.\nCoach: That sounds like a balanced approach.

How can you speak from your perspective to balance being respectful but also being assertive? \nClient: I think I could say something like from my perspective, meeting deadlines is crucial for the success of our team and our projects. I believe that by working together and finding solutions, we can overcome any challenges and ensure better results. I'll try to use \"I\" statements, and make sure that I\u2019m speaking from my perspective; I don\u2019t want them to think the team is talking about them behind their back. I also need to be careful to focus on some of the most recent incidents rather than saying extreme comments like you never make deadlines. Maybe something like \"I've noticed that some deadlines have been missed recently, and it's been challenging for the team to keep up with the extra workload.\"\nCoach: Yes for sure! Describing the issue in neutral terms, focusing on your perspective and using I statements will help the conversation to be constructive. What\u2019s your sense of how your coworker might respond?\nClient: I think they\u2019ll feel defensive at first \u2013 especially since we\u2019ve had this conversation before.They might take it personally \u2013 like I\u2019m attacking their performance -  nobody likes to be called out. They will probably have some reasons for their delays - I want to try to be open-minded and see if there's any way I can offer my help or if there are external factors impacting their ability to meet deadlines.\nCoach: That's a good mindset to have. Being open and supportive can lead to a more productive discussion. What assumptions have you made about what\u2019s going on here and how are you going to check them?\nClient: That\u2019s a good question. I think I\u2019ve just assumed that they don\u2019t care about deadlines the way that I do. I think if I just stay focused on exploring what\u2019s going on for them and not slip into accusations.  \nCoach: It\u2019s so good that you are trying to be aware of the assumptions you are making and being open to checking them out is so important. \nClient: Ya I don\u2019t think I realized that\u2019s what I was thinking until just now.\nCoach: What do you think is the common ground is for you both?\nClient: I think the success of the team is important to us both. I think we also both want to do a good job and feel like our work is valued. We also both want to have enough time to get our work done and for that to be as stress-free as possible!! \nCoach: That will be some really important ground for you to explore together.  How will you recognize that you are ready to move to the next stage?\nClient: I think once I\u2019ve got a clear understanding of their challenges and feel like they\u2019ve really heard my concerns and that they appreciate the impact they have on the team\u2019s performance. \nCoach: Nice!  How will you go about exploring a solution \u2026.or solutions?\n\n********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********\nClient: I think it\u2019s important that the solutions come from them; I want it to actually stick this time so it\u2019s gotta come from them. \nCoach: What are some options that you can see now that might better meet your needs?\nClient: I think that we need clearer project milestones with very specific tasks and timelines \u2026 and more realistic deadlines. \nCoach: That\u2019s a great suggestion. What else might be important to include in the agreement?\nClient: I think we need to meet more regularly \u2013 I think that it would help if I understood what was happening and also it would put us all in a better position to get support \u2013 or to offer support \u2013 if we had a better connection and communication. \nCoach.  That\u2019s excellent.  So, for you, the resolution involves clearer tasks and more realistic timelines as well as increased communication as a team. What do you think?\nClient: I think so but I\u2019m interested in hearing their perspective too.  Maybe there\u2019s something else going on that I don\u2019t know about!\nCoach: Great point!

It sounds like you are open to finding out new information in this conversation and adjusting your plan if needed!\nClient: Yes definitely.\nCoach: What would an effective resolution look like and feel like for you?\nClient: Work would be less stressful for all of us!  I wouldn\u2019t need to nag  and follow up \u2026 things would just get done. \nCoach: That sounds great!  How are you feeling about having this conversation?\nClient: I\u2019m actually looking forward to it!  I think we can figure this out.\nCoach: That\u2019s awesome.  Remember what you\u2019ve said about balancing assertion and empathy and stay in the exploration stage long enough to get a good sense of what\u2019s going on for them.  I can\u2019t wait to here how it goes for you.\nClient: Thanks!\n\n********* STAGE 5: REFLECTION *********\nCoach: So you\u2019ve had the conversation \u2013 I\u2019m curious to hear how it went for you?\nClient: Well overall it went well \u2026 I think.  It started out rough and they were really defensive. I found myself getting frustrated but I kept focusing on our common ground and worked really hard to listen.  I found out a lot of things that I didn\u2019t know about their situation!\nCoach:  And how did that change things for you?\nClient:  It was good to have a better understanding of the whole situation \u2013 not just my own little piece of it. \nCoach: Nice!  How do you feel about your working relationship now?\nClient: I think we\u2019ll be able to build a really good relationship now. I think we both understand each way better.\nCoach: How do you feel about the resolution that you came to?\nClient: I think it will meet my needs vey well. They seem pretty happy too.\nCoach: Is there anything that you would do differently?\nClient: Maybe have the conversation sooner??  I had built up a lot of resentment and I think that was really impacting our relationship \u2013 they could totally feel that which made it harder to talk about this. \nCoach: And how do you think this experience will change your approach to conflict?\nClient: Well I hope I am able to stay curious and be open to others perspectives. Also to check my assumptions and be aware that those are in my head \u2013 they are not facts.  \nCoach: That sounds like an important take away!\nClient: Yes definitely.  Also I think it\u2019s important to prepare for these types of conversations.\nCoach: Hmn \u2013 interesting. In what ways did your preparation support a constructive conversation?\nClient: By clarifying the issue and clearly identying my own needs, it helped me have a more focused conversation.  Also reminding myself to be open and thinking about how I could do that \u2013 especially if they weren\u2019t \u2013 was good. I needed some strategies going in!\nCoach: That sounds like something you can definitely implement in future conversations.\nClient: Definitely! \n", "doc_id": "74bb1f75-501b-4bb6-8917-4b65a6970747", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "569dc32d0f37c0caed4ff1bba35b239afc6e75d561fc42724c799e7ce995f82a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11953, "end": 14722, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "30eb0e27-7d2e-43b6-a6f8-ee5ed0790158", "2": "5ca7fc7b-a138-457e-a75b-9b2752eff069"}}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"fea30c2d-5347-4ff3-a6ea-22d7982830ab": {"doc_ids": ["584213f3-3235-41bb-9dc9-8bfe4630cfaf", "d7cc536a-40af-4d83-90eb-84f92a493ba5", "f194cb0f-9bc7-4d9e-9979-4feec61b19a7", "4846ddec-22a8-4aa8-81ed-d52ae834cdc2", "4f817173-ca01-4ffe-97a3-01b890072fcf"], "extra_info": {}}, "0df5b545-92c7-45cf-b025-7c60d181bfa1": {"doc_ids": ["efd5309a-f5f7-4316-8d32-8887889d1e12", "d3fea5e6-fa93-4338-b7ac-a60318dc59f1", "0a5afe5f-a13c-43cb-a665-7276bcbc7d56"], "extra_info": {}}, "30eb0e27-7d2e-43b6-a6f8-ee5ed0790158": {"doc_ids": ["ae713060-7320-41f2-8d1f-2b967bcd7d39", "b0a99909-f55e-4304-b4f0-ee76486669d1", "5ca7fc7b-a138-457e-a75b-9b2752eff069", "74bb1f75-501b-4bb6-8917-4b65a6970747"], "extra_info": {}}}}
