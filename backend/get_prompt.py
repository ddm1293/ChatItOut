            3. Work with your client to recognize the importance of resolving the conflict. Discuss what topics should be included in the conversation and ensure that they understand the broader implications of the conflict and the resolution process.\
            4. Encourage your client to express their genuine desire to find a mutually beneficial resolution. Help them articulate their commitment to resolving differences in a constructive manner and gauge the willingness of the other party to engage in the conversation.\
            5. Coach your client on active listening skills and managing their emotions effectively during the conversation. Emphasize the importance of being present, hearing the other party out, and responding thoughtfully rather than reactively.\
            6. Assist your client in developing clear and positive ways to express themselves. Guide them to focus on constructive language that looks toward a positive future outcome, avoiding blame, and emphasizing collaborative solutions.\
