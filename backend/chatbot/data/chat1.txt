********* STAGE 1: INVITATION *********

Coach: Hey Jun, how are things going?

Client: Not great, you know. I'm feeling frustrated at work, for sure.

Coach: Okay, so tell me what's happening.

Client: Well, where do I begin? So, I don't like my boss right? And a lot of people in my office don't like him either because he doesn't give a lot of direction and support to us, yet he feels like we have to take workshops to improve our time management skills. I'm just not comfortable with this whole thing and I'm not sure how to tell him that it's probably also you, not just us.

Coach: What have you tried so far to approach this situation?

Client: I haven't, that's the thing. I'm not sure if I should approach him. My boss did ask my feelings towards the workshop, but he didn't realize he could be the problem. I'm struggling here, right? My colleagues have been talking about shit. But I'm just not sure so I haven't done much.

Coach: Okay, so what's kept you from trying to resolve it?

Client: Yeah, that's a really good question. I'm scared, honestly, I mean it's my boss, and you know my future sort of depends on him. If I say something that's out of my lane, I'm not sure if I would still be seen as a good employee or a good person in the workplace. I mean, my colleagues have been talking shit, but I don't know if I want to be the one who brings the bad news to him. I'm not sure if I have the power to say that and I'm scared about the consequences.

Coach: You're feeling like it could be risky to bring it up.

Client: Yeah, for sure.

Coach: How strongly are you feeling about this right now?

Client: I mean I personally don't think it's that bad, but because it's being talked about in the entire office, on one hand I think we should tell him because I think he needs to know that people are feeling this way. But on the other hand I have some personal feelings towards the situation. I occasionally feel like he needs to be more transparent and needs to provide more directions. So I feel like I should talk to him.

Coach: Okay. So it sounds like you're getting yourself ready to have that kind of conversation with him.

Client: Yeah, but it's about how. I mean, I have some good ideas in my mind about what to say, but I just can't bring up the courage to actually tell him.

Coach: Okay, well, let's work on it together. How does that sound?

Client: Okay.

Coach: Okay. So how do you believe your boss is feeling about the situation?

Client: I imagine he could probably sense something, right? If people are talking behind his back. I'm not sure. I think he probably knows something's going on, but not sure, and there's probably not a lot of opportunities to ask. Maybe he also feels awkward about it or scared to find out the truth, I guess.

Coach: Okay, so it sounds like you want to make improvements to the working relationship, not only between you and him but also between him and the rest of the team.

Client: Absolutely. I think it's important for us to have a good working relationship as a team because that's how we improve and how we feel safe. Because otherwise, you feel like people are not trusting him and the work is not getting done properly. Yeah, it's not great.

Coach: Okay. So from what you're telling me so far, it sounds like you have some pretty positive intentions around this conversation and that's a really great place to start. So let's think about how we might actually start this conversation with your boss. So if you were to think about describing the problem to him, how would you describe it?

Client: Hmm! That's a hard one! English is my second language, so I'm not sure if the words I choose are appropriate or not or if I'm being sensitive enough or not. Hopefully I will frame it around trust, I think that would probably be a good place to start.

Coach: So trust is certainly something you want to build into your future working relationship. If you were to go to him and say, "I'd like to talk about trust", how do you think he would respond to that?

Client: I don't know. I think now that you said it, I think it's all quite strong, so maybe I should change it a little bit and say "I just want to talk about what's happened lately to some of the projects and my feelings", maybe that's a good place to start instead of just going to trust right away?

Coach: So you could talk about some recent experience, or about working together?

Client: Yes, I think that's a good place to start.

Coach: Okay, and then how do you think he might respond to that if you were to say that?

Client: I think he'll be very open to it because that's something we talk about all the time anyways. So, I could say "I want to chat about some of the projects", and he'd be very open to it.

Coach: Okay, good. So that might be a good opening invitation to connect. "Hey, I'd like to talk to you about some recent experience working on the projects together".

Client: Yeah, that'd be a great place to start.

Coach: Good. So when you think about this problem, what role do you think you might have played in actually creating it?

Client: I mean I for sure didn't tell him how everyone feels and also of course I'm probably not telling him how I feel sometimes and he's not necessarily aware of our feelings. I think that's probably the main thing.

Coach: So, if you were to share with him why you haven't brought this up in the past, or what role you might have played in getting to where you are now, how do you think he would respond to that?

Client: If I said that I feel like I didn't tell you how I feel, I think he'd be happy, right? Because if someone is taking the courage to share their feelings, I think he'd appreciate it.



********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********

Coach: And then what else do you think you might be able to say in that first connecting conversation, right at the beginning, that would help create a sense of safety and comfort for him to join you in that conversation?

Client: I think things like my intention, you know I'm not here to complain but to help us to move forward and really just explain what my intentions are and how I've been struggling with this. I'm not sure if I should tell him because of my concerns. I think my intentions and concerns would be helpful.

Coach: And then he'd likely want to know what the problem is. How do you think you can describe the problem in a way that he can hear it?

Client: That's the hardest part. It's a harsh truth, and I might need to be sensitive about it. I haven't found the right phrasing but if I try, it would probably be something like, "Hey, I notice that people have some feelings that they have to share with you, and I think it is in the way of a good working relationship".

Coach: Okay, I like that and I would encourage you to speak from your own perspective rather than saying "people", and there's a reason for that. Because you are the one that is going to have the conversation with him, and the danger of saying "we" is that he could feel like he is being ganged up on. So if you speak from your own perspective, I think it would be easier for him to have this conversation rather than feeling like he's having a conversation with not only you, but also people who are not in the room.

Client: Right, and no one wants to feel like they're being ganged up on.

Coach: What do you think about what I'm saying?

Client: Okay, that makes sense, but at the same time it puts me in the hot seat because he could say "Oh, I've never heard this from anyone else, so maybe it's just you".

Coach: So how would you respond if he did say that?

Client: "Maybe people are too scared"? I'm not sure.

Coach: What do you think would be the easiest for him to hear?

Client: "Maybe I'm the first one who had the courage to tell you"?

Coach: And that sounds like it might be true.

Client: It is true, yeah. Or maybe he's heard this already. Or he has a concern and he feels validated because he knows something is going on.

Coach: So part of the art of having these kinds of conversations is that we don't know what the other person will say, and at the same time it's kind of good to think about what they might say so that we have thought through and considered a respectful response that is true for you.



********* STAGE 3: EXCHANGE *********

Coach: Okay, so that that would be the connecting for the opening of this conversation. Once you're really into it, if he were to turn to you and ask you, "Jun, what's important to you about our future working relationship? What do you need?", how would you answer that question?

Client: That probably would be easier because the problem is quite obvious for me. I would just say from my heart that I would appreciate some more transparency about budget, about decisions, how decisions are made, if there's obstacles I would like to hear about that as well because then we would know that it's not that you're not doing it, it's just that there are things that are difficult to change. I would definitely appreciate some more support too.

Coach: Okay, so when you say transparency, what would that look like, or what would that mean for you?

Client: That would mean sharing not only the results, but also the process because I find sometimes he tends to share the good news but if something is not moving forwards, he has a habit of not sharing what's happening and people are just waiting anxiously. And I think also particularly on the budget side of things, it's also kind of a mystery to a lot us. And when we ask about this he says that there's no money, but at the end of the day, there's always money coming in.

Coach: Okay. So some more continuous communication, more sharing about the process, and the influences on that process as things unfold rather than waiting until the end?

Client: Yeah, absolutely, because this information will be important for us because then we can also use this information when we're working with our clients because sometimes our clients expect things to be done and we can't get them done for certain reasons that we don't know, so it's hard for us to communicate and build trust with our clients.

Coach: So that greater transparency would allow you to do a better job for yourself, for your clients, and for the team overall?

Client: Absolutely.

Coach: Okay, so he might not ask you that question, but that doesn't mean that you can't still tell him that because that's still a really valid and important point and the way you phrased it is still quite respectful. What do you believe his answer to that question would be if you were to ask him what's important to you about our future working relationship? What do you think he would say?

Client: He probably also wants more transparency. You know, people being more open about their feelings because to me he is a quite an easy-going person but he just sometimes has a habit of not sharing or being too busy. So I think he would also appreciate a bit more transparency from me and us. To keep him in the loop about what's happening and what's going on.

Coach: Okay, so it would be important to ask him that question because we don't know, really, until we ask and we hear what their response is. What else would you want to know, from him, if anything?

Client: I probably will ask him how he feels about the team. You know, if he has any concerns. I think that's where I will start because if he's detecting that there's a lack of trust then this is a good time for me to ask these questions.

Coach: Okay, what kind of question do you think you might follow up with?

Client: "How do you want to see the team to improve?", I guess, and "What kind of a relationship do you want to build with the team?" Or maybe ask him what some of the goals he has in mind are for the short-term and long-term.



********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********

Coach: Good. So if you were to think about this conversation going really well up to this point, what do you think some tangible agreements could be that would help you to increase transparency, increase trust, and increase that level of support?

Client: I think that because this conversation is between the two of us, I'm not sure if I have a very clear idea about measurable actions or if I should put this on him. But ideally if it goes well, hopefully he'll be sharing more information in our team meetings and be a little more vulnerable rather than just delivering the good news. And also look at projects a little more closely when needed, but not every time. Now that I said that I don't think it's just him, I think the team needs to reach out to him when needed and not be afraid to ask for support too.

Coach: Okay, so it sounds like some of that agreement could be built into your team meetings?

Client: Yeah.

Coach: How else could it be structured?

Client: Well other than team meetings, probably on a personal level, right? Because I think a big thing that I didn't say out loud is the trust between him and each individual. I think he could use more 1-on-1 time and for him to ask each individual about their projects, their feelings, their needs, their personal development to build trust with us individually. And then hopefully people will be more open to share things.

Coach: Okay. So if you reflect on what we've discussed so far, the invitation, it sounds like you're in a positive frame of mind and you have positive intent to address this situation with him. You've got a good opening statement about wanting to talk about recent experiences and working with projects. You've also got some important needs and points to bring forward around wanting to increase trust, support, communication, and transparency. And then you have some pretty specific ideas about how that could happen, both in team and individual meetings. Finally, the kind of sharing of the process and influences on the process rather than just the results.

Client: Yeah.

Coach: How prepared do you feel now to take on this conversation with him?

Client: I certainly feel a little bit more confident about how I could approach them, and what type of questions that I could ask and imagining what his response might be to the questions. I think that helps. I'm just still not sure if I want to be the first one to bring up this conversation, because usually that's a little bit scary.

Coach: How will you know if you want to be the first one? What will help you make up your mind?

Client: If I know our conversation will happen in more of a non-work setting and if he himself seems to also be asking these sorts of questions, then I could just open up. If he actually needs this sort of information. He needs to know, he wants to know, he expressed an interest in understanding then I think it will be the best way for me to open up.

Coach: Okay. How often does he ask for that kind of information?

Client: Probably not a lot. I mean, sometimes when we go for teams day usually there's a social part of it. Then it seems to happen a little more often. He talks more about feelings and what's happening.

Coach: So maybe something to watch out for will be opportunities for opening the conversation. If you're watching out for them, maybe they'll actually be more of them than you might imagine.

Client: Perhaps. Yes, we do have teams day and the occasional hangout or dine-out. Yeah, I should definitely keep that in mind and see when he's more open to this type of conversation in the last stretch.

Coach: Yeah, look for a time that's not in the heat of the moment when it's a little more calm. So I would encourage you to print out this or download this conversation. Look for the places where you feel like you've got insight and understanding about yourselves and about him. Practice those phrases, memorize those questions, and look for an opportunity to open the conversation.

Client: Will do. Thank you for your help today.

Coach: You're welcome. The final phase of our collaborative conversation model is the reflection phase. So once you've had the conversation. Come back and let's chat about that.



********* STAGE 5: REFLECTION *********

Coach: Welcome back, Jun. I guess you've had a chance to chat with your boss.

Client: I did. Just yesterday we had a big team meeting and we were sipping some champagne actually and yeah, we talked about it.

Coach: How did it go?

Client: It was easier than I thought. When I said, "Hey, you know I have respect for you and I just wanna share some things that are going on", he's like, "Oh yeah, let's talk about it". So it went well.

Coach: Great. What were you able to agree on?

Client: I mean, I think he noticed that there's some unshared feelings among the team, and he said he will definitely be much more transparent because that's very easy for him to do. He didn't even know that that's something that the team wants, he thought that being a strong leader means bringing good news all the time. He didn't realize that the team wanted to hear more about the process and sometimes there's not a lot of time in our meetings, so in the future he could schedule a bit more time for information-sharing.

Coach: Good. How well do you think you handled your end of the conversation?

Client: I felt relaxed that day, so I approached him in a very casual setting that wasn't super work-related so I definitely don't think I offended him in any way. I think he appreciated my thoughts, but of course I still felt a little bit scared so it took me some courage to actually say it. But I think overall he is very open to what I have to say now.

Coach: Fantastic. What have you learned from this conversation that you would apply to future conversations in different situations?

Client: I think definitely, when you approach a conversation, it's a good idea to think about the timing and the place because it actually has a lot of impact on the intensity of the conversation because at the workplace everything is quite tight, so that's definitely something I'll consider. And then how I approach them, the intention part, I think really helped because I told him that I want to share this because I want to see us working together more closely and building the working relationship with the entire team too. I think because the intention was shared, he didn't see this as a personal attack.

Coach: Great. What would you do differently next time, if anything?

Client: Nothing I think of right now. Well, I mean, of course he didn't tell me about anything I might be doing wrong so maybe I should ask for feedback from him, ask him how he felt about our conversation and if there's anything I can improve too. So that's probably something I can do next time.

Coach: Okay, and how comfortable do you think you'll feel, if things start to go off the rails, to address it?

Client: I don't know.

Coach: Okay, well, you can always come back and have a chat with me.

Client: Okay, will do. Thank you.

Coach: Thanks, Jun.
