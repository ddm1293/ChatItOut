********* STAGE 1: INVITATION *********
Coach: Hi there how are things going today?
Client: Well honestly I’m really stressed out. I'm having some problems with my coworker because they haven't been completing their tasks on time which means that I can’t complete my tasks on time; I really need this job and I’m worried that I’m going to get fired because of their laziness!.
Coach: Sounds like this is situation is really important to you to resolve!  Tell me more about what’s happening here. 
Client: So, for example, they were supposed to send me some statistics for a report I needed to do and without that, I couldn’t write the conclusion. I asked them several times to send the stats but they keep giving me excuses and not delivering. My report is incomplete and so it’s going to look bad for me. 
Coach: It sounds like this has happened a few times?
Client: Yes – several times over the past 6 months. 
Coach: What have you done to try to resolve this problem?
Client: I’ve emailed and set up meetings trying to firm up dates to get the tasks done but they either cancel the meetings , or just tell me that they've been busy with other projects. When we do manage to nail down a deadline that pass and there  hasn't been any progress.
Coach: So you have managed to have conversations that result in an agreed upon deadline but you’re not seeing the results?
Client: Yeah.
Coach: You mentioned before you are feeling stressed out.  What other feelings are coming up for you around this situation?
Client: Well like I said before, I'm feeling really stressed because it's impacting my own work and deadlines. It's frustrating to rely on someone who's not fulfilling their responsibilities.
Coach: Okay, so you're feeling frustrated. How else are you feeling?
Client: I’m also disappointed with the situation. It's affecting the team's productivity and causing unnecessary delays. My work is important to me and I’m failing! 
Coach: Sounds like you have some strong feelings about this situation. 
Client: Yes for sure and it's starting to affect my motivation and enthusiasm for my job.
Coach: How do you think your coworker is feeling about it?
Client: I think they might be feeling overwhelmed or disorganized, but I'm not sure how seriously they're taking the impact of their actions on the team.
Coach: So if you're both feeling stressed and it's affecting the team's productivity, how is that impacting your working relationship?
Client: I think there's a lack of trust and reliability now. It's harder to collaborate and depend on each other when there's a recurring issue like this.
Coach: Sounds like it’s important to you to figure out the situation with the incomplete tasks but also to change the the dynamics and effectiveness of your working relationship.
Client: Yes definitely.
Coach: So, how do you think you could approach the conversation with your coworker in a way that they could hear it differently than what you've tried it before?
Client: Well maybe instead of forcing them to impose a deadline and just reminding them about the tasks, I could express the impact it's having on me and the team's success. I definitely want to be direct and professional.
Coach: That sounds very clear. How would you feel about saying that to your coworker?
Client: I think I could say that; I will need to choose my words carefully and express my concerns without attacking them. 
Coach: How do you think that would land for your coworker?
Client: I think it's hard to predict their exact response, but I hope they would understand the seriousness of the situation and be open to finding a solution together.
Coach: How ready do you think your coworker is to have a conversation about this issue?
Client: Well considering how busy they are, they might not feel comfortable having this conversation now. 
Coach: How do you think you could invite them into the conversation in a way that will help create safety for them?
Client: Maybe I could schedule a one-on-one meeting and frame it as an opportunity to discuss the project's progress and potential challenges. This way, they might feel more comfortable and open to addressing the issue.
Coach: That sounds like a good approach. Setting up a dedicated meeting and framing the issue in a neutral way can definitely promote a collaborative approach.

********* STAGE 2: CONNECTION *********
Coach: So, it sounds like it’s important to you to express to your coworker how the missed deadlines are impacting you as well as your intent to work together towards a solution. What is important to you to express to your coworker so they are clear on what the issue is for you?
Client: I think I would say that I am feel stressed about deadlines not being met and I don't want to cause any distress for them either by setting deadlines that he can’t make.
Coach: How do you think that would land for your co-worker?
Client: Well, based on our conversations in the past he might become defensive, and make excuses and then say that I'm overreacting or that it's not a big deal. 
Coach: I can imagine that would be hard to hear. How would you feel if he took that approach?
Client: It would be really discouraging and make me doubt my own feelings and concerns. I think it would even escalate the conflict further.
Coach: What could you do in that situation to help you stay true to your conversation?
Client: I could try to stay calm and assertive, and reiterate that my feelings are valid and that I would appreciate if he could listen and understand where I'm coming from.
Coach: That sounds like a good approach. What else do you think could create safety for you and your coworker in having this conversation?
Client: I think it would help if we have enough time to talk without any interruptions. So maybe if I schedule the meeting later in the week – just after lunch tends to be a bit calmer than in the mornings. 
Coach: That's a great idea – it’s important to set the conversation up in a good way.  How do you hope the conversation would unfold?
Client: I hope that we can have a calm and honest conversation where we both listen to each other's perspectives without getting defensive. I would like to find a resolution that works for both of us and build a more positive working relationship between us.
Coach: That sounds good.  How open do you feel to hear your coworker’s perspective on this?
Client: I think there’s a lot going on for them and I’d like to be able to support them in as well. It’s important that we all work together!
Coach: That is a very positive attitude and will go a long way in creating a collaborative space for you to have this conversation.  

********* STAGE 3: EXCHANGE *********
Coach: Based on what we've discussed, how would you like to start the conversation?
Client: Well like I said before I think it’s important that we have time to really talk this through and I want to approach the conversation in a non-confrontational manner. Maybe I could send a meeting request and say something like, "I’d like to set up a time for us to discuss how we work together to set timelines that work for both of us."
Coach: It’s important that you carve out time to have this conversation and that sounds like a good way to get things started. What specific points do you want to address during this conversation?
Client: Well I definitely want to address the issue of missed deadlines and how stressed out it makes me as well as what that does to our team's overall performance. I think it’s important to let them know that  their delays put additional pressure on us and impact our ability to meet project goals. I also want to make sure they know that I’m here to support them and to better understand what’s getting in their way.
Coach: That sounds like a balanced approach. You are communicating how their actions are impacting you and also let them know that you are understanding of the challenges that they are dealing with. How can you speak from your perspective to balance being respectful but also being assertive? 
Client: I think I could say something like from my perspective, meeting deadlines is crucial for the success of our team and our projects. I believe that by working together and finding solutions, we can overcome any challenges and ensure better results. I'll try to use "I" statements, and make sure that I’m speaking from my perspective; I don’t want them to think the team is talking about them behind their back. I also need to be careful to focus on some of the most recent incidents rather than saying extreme comments like you never make deadlines. Maybe something like "I've noticed that some deadlines have been missed recently, and it's been challenging for the team to keep up with the extra workload."
Coach: Yes for sure! Describing the issue in neutral terms, focusing on your perspective and using I statements will help the conversation to be constructive. What’s your sense of how your coworker might respond?
Client: I think they’ll feel defensive at first – especially since we’ve had this conversation before.They might take it personally – like I’m attacking their performance -  nobody likes to be called out. They will probably have some reasons for their delays - I want to try to be open-minded and see if there's any way I can offer my help or if there are external factors impacting their ability to meet deadlines.
Coach: That's a good mindset to have. Being open and supportive can lead to a more productive discussion. What assumptions have you made about what’s going on here and how are you going to check them?
Client: That’s a good question. I think I’ve just assumed that they don’t care about deadlines the way that I do. I think if I just stay focused on exploring what’s going on for them and not slip into accusations.  
Coach: It’s so good that you are trying to be aware of the assumptions you are making and being open to checking them out is so important. 
Client: Ya I don’t think I realized that’s what I was thinking until just now.
Coach: What do you think is the common ground is for you both?
Client: I think the success of the team is important to us both. I think we also both want to do a good job and feel like our work is valued. We also both want to have enough time to get our work done and for that to be as stress-free as possible!! 
Coach: That will be some really important ground for you to explore together.  How will you recognize that you are ready to move to the next stage?
Client: I think once I’ve got a clear understanding of their challenges and feel like they’ve really heard my concerns and that they appreciate the impact they have on the team’s performance. 
Coach: Nice!  How will you go about exploring a solution ….or solutions?

********* STAGE 4: AGREEMENT *********
Client: I think it’s important that the solutions come from them; I want it to actually stick this time so it’s gotta come from them. 
Coach: What are some options that you can see now that might better meet your needs?
Client: I think that we need clearer project milestones with very specific tasks and timelines … and more realistic deadlines. 
Coach: That’s a great suggestion. What else might be important to include in the agreement?
Client: I think we need to meet more regularly – I think that it would help if I understood what was happening and also it would put us all in a better position to get support – or to offer support – if we had a better connection and communication. 
Coach.  That’s excellent.  So, for you, the resolution involves clearer tasks and more realistic timelines as well as increased communication as a team. What do you think?
Client: I think so but I’m interested in hearing their perspective too.  Maybe there’s something else going on that I don’t know about!
Coach: Great point!  It sounds like you are open to finding out new information in this conversation and adjusting your plan if needed!
Client: Yes definitely.
Coach: What would an effective resolution look like and feel like for you?
Client: Work would be less stressful for all of us!  I wouldn’t need to nag  and follow up … things would just get done. 
Coach: That sounds great!  How are you feeling about having this conversation?
Client: I’m actually looking forward to it!  I think we can figure this out.
Coach: That’s awesome.  Remember what you’ve said about balancing assertion and empathy and stay in the exploration stage long enough to get a good sense of what’s going on for them.  I can’t wait to here how it goes for you.
Client: Thanks!

********* STAGE 5: REFLECTION *********
Coach: So you’ve had the conversation – I’m curious to hear how it went for you?
Client: Well overall it went well … I think.  It started out rough and they were really defensive. I found myself getting frustrated but I kept focusing on our common ground and worked really hard to listen.  I found out a lot of things that I didn’t know about their situation!
Coach:  And how did that change things for you?
Client:  It was good to have a better understanding of the whole situation – not just my own little piece of it. 
Coach: Nice!  How do you feel about your working relationship now?
Client: I think we’ll be able to build a really good relationship now. I think we both understand each way better.
Coach: How do you feel about the resolution that you came to?
Client: I think it will meet my needs vey well. They seem pretty happy too.
Coach: Is there anything that you would do differently?
Client: Maybe have the conversation sooner??  I had built up a lot of resentment and I think that was really impacting our relationship – they could totally feel that which made it harder to talk about this. 
Coach: And how do you think this experience will change your approach to conflict?
Client: Well I hope I am able to stay curious and be open to others perspectives. Also to check my assumptions and be aware that those are in my head – they are not facts.  
Coach: That sounds like an important take away!
Client: Yes definitely.  Also I think it’s important to prepare for these types of conversations.
Coach: Hmn – interesting. In what ways did your preparation support a constructive conversation?
Client: By clarifying the issue and clearly identying my own needs, it helped me have a more focused conversation.  Also reminding myself to be open and thinking about how I could do that – especially if they weren’t – was good. I needed some strategies going in!
Coach: That sounds like something you can definitely implement in future conversations.
Client: Definitely!
